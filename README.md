# C# Hash to Color
I want to rewrite <a href="https://github.com/zenozeng/color-hash">Zenozong</a> 
color to hash code in C# as a practice for myself, 
I may or may not commit code as often as it need to, but I'll try my best :)<br/>

This app will get an entry text string and use BKDRHash for hashing and after that try to convert it to Hex color.<br/>

This project is already done by <a href="https://github.com/zenozeng">Zenozong</a> in javascript, 
and you can see <a href="https://github.com/zenozeng/color-hash">here</a>.
